  abstract = {This paper is concerned with the class imbalance problem which has been known to hinder the learning performance of classification algorithms. The problem occurs when there are significantly less number of observations of the target concept. Various real-world classification tasks, such as medical diagnosis, text categorization and fraud detection suffer from this phenomenon. The standard machine learning algorithms yield better prediction performance with balanced data-sets. In this paper, we demonstrate that active learning is capable of solving the class imbalance problem by providing the learner more balanced classes. We also propose an efficient way of selecting informative instances from a smaller pool of samples for active learning which does not necessitate a search through the entire data-set. The proposed method yields an efficient querying system and allows active learning to be applied to very large data-sets. Our experimental results show that with an early stopping criteria, active learning achieves a fast solution with competitive prediction performance in imbalanced data classification.},

  abstract = 	 {Even though active learning forms an important pillar of machine learning, deep learning tools are not prevalent within it. Deep learning poses several difficulties when used in an active learning setting. First, active learning (AL) methods generally rely on being able to learn and update models from small amounts of data. Recent advances in deep learning, on the other hand, are notorious for their dependence on large amounts of data. Second, many AL acquisition functions rely on model uncertainty, yet deep learning methods rarely represent such model uncertainty. In this paper we combine recent advances in Bayesian deep learning into the active learning framework in a practical way. We develop an active learning framework for high dimensional data, a task which has been extremely challenging so far, with very sparse existing literature. Taking advantage of specialised models such as Bayesian convolutional neural networks, we demonstrate our active learning techniques with image data, obtaining a significant improvement on existing active learning approaches. We demonstrate this on both the MNIST data-set, as well as for skin cancer diagnosis from lesion images (ISIC2016 task).}

It is simple to implement, can be solved efficiently by standard linear algebra software, and very often outperforms traditional clustering algorithms such as the k-means algorithm. On the first glance spectral clustering appears slightly mysterious, and it is not obvious to see why it works at all and what it really does. The goal of this tutorial is to give some intuition on those questions. We describe different graph Laplacians and their basic properties, present the most common spectral clustering algorithms, and derive those algorithms from scratch by several different approaches. Advantages and disadvantages of the different spectral clustering algorithms are discussed.},

The discretization is efficiently computed in an iterative fashion using singular value decomposition and nonmaximum suppression. The resulting discrete solutions are nearly global-optimal.

We show that when the imposed noise satisfies the Tsybakov low noise condition (Mammen, Tsybakov, and others 1999; Tsybakov 2004) the algorithm is able to adapt to unknown level of noise and achieves optimal statistical rate up to poly-logarithmic factors. We also derive lower bounds for margin based active learning algorithms under Tsybakov noise conditions (TNC) for the membership query synthesis scenario (Angluin 1988). Our result implies lower bounds for the stream based selective sampling scenario (Cohn 1990) under TNC for some fairly simple data distributions. Quite surprisingly, we show that the sample complexity cannot be improved even if the underlying data distribution is as simple as the uniform distribution on the unit ball. Our proof involves the construction of a well separated hypothesis set on the d-dimensional unit ball along with carefully designed label distributions for the Tsybakov noise condition. Our analysis might provide insights for other forms of lower bounds as well.},

@article{Hsu2010,
abstract = {This dissertation develops and analyzes active learning algorithms for binary classification problems. In passive (non-active) learning, a learner uses a random sample of labeled examples from a fixed distribution to select a hypothesis with low error. In active learning, a learner receives only a sample of unlabeled data, but has the option to query the label of any of these data points. The hope is that the active learner needs to query the labels of just a few, carefully chosen points in order to produce a hypothesis with low error.$\backslash$nThe first part of this dissertation develops algorithms based on maintaining a version space—the set of hypotheses still in contention to be selected. The version space is specifically designed to tolerate arbitrary label noise and model mismatch in the agnostic learning model. The algorithms maintain the version space using a reduction to a special form of agnostic learning that allows for example-based constraints; this represents a computational improvement over previous methods. The generalization behavior of one of these algorithms is rigorously analyzed using a quantity called the disagreement coefficient. This algorithm is shown to have label complexity that improves over that of previous methods, and matches known label complexity lower bounds in certain cases.$\backslash$nThe second part of this dissertation develops algorithms based on simpler reductions to agnostic learning that more closely match the standard abstraction of supervised learning procedures. The generalization behavior of these algorithms are also analyzed in the agnostic learning model, and are shown to have label com- plexity similar to the version space methods. Therefore, these algorithms represent qualitative improvements over version space methods, as strict version space meth- ods can be risky to deploy in practice. The first of these algorithms is based on a relaxation of a version space method, and the second is based on an importance weighting technique. The second algorithm is also shown to automatically adapt to various noise conditions that imply a tighter label complexity analysis. Exper- iments using this algorithm are also presented to illustrate some of the promise of the method.},

abstract = "We present a framework for active learning in the multiple-instance (MI) setting. In an MI learning problem, instances are naturally organized into bags and it is the bags, instead of individual instances, that are labeled for training. MI learners assume that every instance in a bag labeled negative is actually negative, whereas at least one instance in a bag labeled positive is actually positive. We consider the particular case in which an MI learner is allowed to selectively query unlabeled instances from positive bags. This approach is well motivated in domains in which it is inexpensive to acquire bag labels and possible, but expensive, to acquire instance labels. We describe a method for learning from labels at mixed levels of granularity, and introduce two active query selection strategies motivated by the MI setting. Our experiments show that learning from instance labels can significantly improve performance of a basic MI learning algorithm in two multiple-instance domains: content-based image retrieval and text classification.",

abstract = {For many types of machine learning algorithms, one can compute the statistically `optimal' way to select training data. In this paper, we review how optimal data selection techniques have been used with feedforward neural networks. We then show how the same principles may be used to select data for two alternative, statistically-based learning architectures: mixtures of Gaussians and locally weighted regression. While the techniques for neural networks are computationally expensive and approximate, the techniques for mixtures of Gaussians and locally weighted regression are both efficient and accurate. Empirically, we observe that the optimality criterion sharply decreases the number of training examples the learner needs in order to achieve good performance.},

A simplified version of this approach is effective in natural 2D images. We evaluated our approach on Electron Microscopy and Magnetic Resonance image volumes, as well as on natural images.

Leveraging this idea, cosegmentation jointly segments common regions from multiple images. In this paper, we propose CoSand, a distributed cosegmentation approach for a highly variable large-scale image collection. The segmentation task is modeled by temperature maximization on anisotropic heat diffusion, of which the temperature maximization with finite K heat sources corresponds to a K-way segmentation that maximizes the segmentation confidence of every pixel in an image. We show that our method takes advantage of a strong theoretic property in that the temperature under linear anisotropic diffusion is a submodular function; therefore, a greedy algorithm guarantees at least a constant factor approximation to the optimal solution for temperature maximization. Our theoretic result is successfully applied to scalable cosegmentation as well as diversity ranking and single-image segmentation. We evaluate CoSand on MSRC and ImageNet data-sets, and show its competence both in competitive performance over previous work, and in much superior scalability.},

The goal of this paper is to provide an experimental comparison of the efficiency of min-cut/max flow algorithms for applications in vision. We compare the running times of several standard algorithms, as well as a new algorithm that we have recently developed. The algorithms we study include both Goldberg-Tarjan style "push -relabel" methods and algorithms based on Ford-Fulkerson style "augmenting paths." We benchmark these algorithms on a number of typical graphs in the contexts of image restoration, stereo, and segmentation. In many cases, our new algorithm works several times faster than any of the other methods, making near real-time performance possible.

title = "Evaluation of prostate segmentation algorithms for {MRI}: The {PROMISE12} challenge",
abstract = "Prostate MRI image segmentation has been an area of intense research due to the increased use of MRI as a modality for the clinical workup of prostate cancer. Segmentation is useful for various tasks, e.g. to accurately localize prostate boundaries for radiotherapy or to initialize multi-modal registration algorithms. In the past, it has been difficult for research groups to evaluate prostate segmentation algorithms on multi-center, multi-vendor and multi-protocol data. Especially because we are dealing with MR images, image appearance, resolution and the presence of artifacts are affected by differences in scanners and/or protocols, which in turn can have a large influence on algorithm accuracy. The Prostate MR Image Segmentation (PROMISE12) challenge was setup to allow a fair and meaningful comparison of segmentation methods on the basis of performance and robustness. In this work we will discuss the initial results of the online PROMISE12 challenge, and the results obtained in the live challenge workshop hosted by the MICCAI2012 conference. In the challenge, 100 prostate MR cases from 4 different centers were included, with differences in scanner manufacturer, field strength and protocol. A total of 11 teams from academic research groups and industry participated. Algorithms showed a wide variety in methods and implementation, including active appearance models, atlas registration and level sets. Evaluation was performed using boundary and volume based metrics which were combined into a single score relating the metrics to human expert performance. The winners of the challenge where the algorithms by teams Imorphics and ScrAutoProstate, with scores of 85.72 and 84.29 overall. Both algorithms where significantly better than all other algorithms in the challenge (p < 0.05) and had an efficient implementation with a run time of 8. min and 3. s per case respectively. Overall, active appearance model based approaches seemed to outperform other approaches like multi-atlas registration, both on accuracy and computation time. Although average algorithm performance was good to excellent and the Imorphics algorithm outperformed the second observer on average, we showed that algorithm combination might lead to further improvement, indicating that optimal performance for prostate segmentation is not yet obtained.

abstract = {Weakly-supervised image segmentation is a challenging problem with multidisciplinary applications in multimedia content analysis and beyond. It aims to segment an image by leveraging its image-level semantics (i.e., tags). This paper presents a weakly-supervised image segmentation algorithm that learns the distribution of spatially structural superpixel sets from image-level labels. More specifically, we first extract graphlets from a given image, which are small-sized graphs consisting of superpixels and encapsulating their spatial structure. Then, an efficient manifold embedding algorithm is proposed to transfer labels from training images into graphlets. It is further observed that there are numerous redundant graphlets that are not discriminative to semantic categories, which are abandoned by a graphlet selection scheme as they make no contribution to the subsequent segmentation. Thereafter, we use a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to learn the distribution of the selected post-embedding graphlets (i.e., vectors output from the graphlet embedding). Finally, we propose an image segmentation algorithm, termed representative graphlet cut, which leverages the learned GMM prior to measure the structure homogeneity of a test image. Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art weakly-supervised image segmentation methods, on five popular segmentation data sets. Besides, our approach performs competitively to the fully-supervised segmentation models.},

@article{Gal2017,
abstract = {Even though active learning forms an important pillar of machine learning, deep learning tools are not prevalent within it. Deep learning poses several difficulties when used in an active learning setting. First, active learning (AL) methods generally rely on being able to learn and update models from small amounts of data. Recent advances in deep learning, on the other hand, are notorious for their dependence on large amounts of data. Second, many AL acquisition functions rely on model uncertainty, yet deep learning methods rarely represent such model uncertainty. In this paper we combine recent advances in Bayesian deep learning into the active learning framework in a practical way. We develop an active learning framework for high dimensional data, a task which has been extremely challenging so far, with very sparse existing literature. Taking advantage of specialised models such as Bayesian convolutional neural networks, we demonstrate our active learning techniques with image data, obtaining a significant improvement on existing active learning approaches. We demonstrate this on both the MNIST data-set, as well as for skin cancer diagnosis from lesion images (ISIC2016 task).},

Classical image segmentation tools use either texture (colour) information, e.g. Magic Wand, or edge (contrast) information, e.g. Intelligent Scissors. Recently, an approach based on optimization by graph-cut has been developed which successfully combines both types of information. In this paper we extend the graph-cut approach in three respects. First, we have developed a more powerful, iterative version of the optimisation. Secondly, the power of the iterative algorithm is used to simplify substantially the user interaction needed for a given quality of result. Thirdly, a robust algorithm for "border matting" has been developed to estimate simultaneously the alpha-matte around an object boundary and the colours of foreground pixels. We show that for moderately difficult examples the proposed method outperforms competitive tools.},

Most existing methods train from fully supervised images, where each pixel is annotated by a class label. To reduce the annotation effort, recently a few weakly supervised approaches emerged. These require only image labels indicating which classes are present. Although their performance reaches a satisfactory level, there is still a substantial gap between the accuracy of fully and weakly supervised methods. We address this gap with a novel active learning method specifically suited for this setting. We model the problem as a pairwise CRF and cast active learning as finding its most informative nodes. These nodes induce the largest expected change in the overall CRF state, after revealing their true label. Our criterion is equivalent to maximizing an upper-bound on accuracy gain. Experiments on two data-sets show that our method achieves 97{\%} percent of the accuracy of the corresponding fully supervised model, while querying less than 17{\%} of the (super-)pixel labels.},

To solve this problem, we introduce a new form of convolutional neural network, called CRF-RNN, which expresses a Conditional Random Field (CRF) as a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Our short network can be plugged in as a part of a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to obtain an end-to-end system that has desirable properties of both CNNs and CRFs. Importantly, our system fully integrates CRF modelling with CNNs, making it possible to train the whole system end-to-end with the usual back-propagation algorithm.

@article{Settles2011,
abstract = {This article surveys recent work in active learning aimed at making it more practical for real-world use. In general, active learning systems aim to make machine learning more economical, since they can participate in the acquisition of their own training data. An active learner might iteratively select informative query instances to be labeled by an oracle, for example. Work over the last two decades has shown that such approaches are e ective at maintaining accuracy while reducing training set size in many machine learning applications. However, as we begin to deploy active learning in real ongoing learning systems and data annotation projects, we are encountering unexpected problems|due in part to practical realities that violate the basic assumptions of earlier foundational work. I review some of these issues, and discuss recent work being done to address the challenges.},

@article{Dasgupta2009,
abstract = {Active learning is defined by contrast to the passive model of supervised learning where all the labels for learning are obtained without reference to the learning algorithm, while in active learning the learner interactively chooses which data points to label. The hope of active learning is that interaction can substantially reduce the number of labels required, making solving problems via machine learning more practical. This hope is known to be valid in certain special cases, both empirically and theoretically. Variants of active learning have been investigated over several decades and fields. The focus of this tutorial is on general techniques which are applicable to many problems. At a mathematical level, this corresponds to approaches with provable guarantees under weakest-possible assumptions since real problems are more likely to fit algorithms which work under weak assumptions. We believe this tutorial should be of broad interest. People working on or using supervised learning are often confronted with the need for more labels, where active learning can help. Similarly, in reinforcement learning, generalizing while interacting in more complex ways is an active research topic. Please join us.},

@article{Planck2006,
abstract = {In recent years, spectral clustering has become one of the most popular modern clustering algorithms. It is simple to implement, can be solved efficiently by standard linear algebra software, and very often outperforms traditional clustering algorithms such as the k-means algorithm. Nevertheless, on the first glance spectral clustering looks a bit mysterious, and it is not obvious to see why it works at all and what it really does. This article is a tutorial introduction to spectral clustering. We describe different graph Laplacians and their basic properties, present the most common spectral clustering algorithms, and derive those algorithms from scratch by several different approaches. Advantages and disadvantages of the different spectral clustering algorithms are discussed.},

@article{Tong2001,
abstract = {Support vector machines have met with significant success in numerous real-world learning tasks. However, like most machine learning algorithms, they are generally applied using a randomly selected training set classified in advance. In many settings, we also have the option ofusing pool-based active learning. Instead ofusing a randomly selected training set, the learner has access to a pool ofunlabeled instances and can request the labels for some number of them. We introduce a new algorithm for performing active learning with support vector machines, i.e., an algorithm for choosing which instances to request next. We provide a theoretical motivation for the algorithm using the notion of a version space. We present experimental results showing that employing our active learning method can significantly reduce the need for labeled training instances in both the standard inductive and transductive settings},

@article{Settles2010,
abstract = {The key idea behind active learning is that a machine learning algorithm can achieve greater accuracy with fewer training labels if it is allowed to choose the data from which it learns. An active learner may pose queries, usually in the form of unlabeled data instances to be labeled by an oracle (e.g., a human annotator). Active learning is well-motivated in many modern machine learning problems, where unlabeled data may be abundant or easily obtained, but labels are difficult, time-consuming, or expensive to obtain. This report provides a general introduction to active learning and a survey of the literature. This includes a discussion of the scenarios in which queries can be formulated, and an overview of the query strategy frameworks proposed in the literature to date. An analysis of the empirical and theoretical evidence for successful active learning, a summary of problem setting variants and practical issues, and a discussion of related topics in machine learning research are also presented.},
